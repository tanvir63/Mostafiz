			<h3>You will get 2 seconds time for each image 
        	to shuffle and if you press correct 
        	(for example fly button for something which flies) 
        	then you will get 100 points and the next image will be called, 
        	and if you presses wrong button, then there would be 0 points and 
        	the next image will be called. Even if you do not 
        	press any button in 2 seconds, 0 points will be given and next 
        	image will be called. There would be total of 20 random images 
        	from the whole collection of images in this level, 
        	and you must at least identify 15 images to unlock the next level, 
        	otherwise there will be game over.</h3>
